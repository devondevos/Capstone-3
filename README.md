# Capstone-3
My Todo List website. 
Created using html, css, js (node.js, express, ajax, jquery) and bootstrap
(the &copy; is not real, I just added it there to look nice)(use 'npm i' to install the required node modules, and node index.js to view the webpage, I installed nodemon globally so it won't show here)
The 'Contact' and 'About' pages are empty because I intend to reuse it later.

Where the user can submit data, edit data and delete data and is responsive to screen sizes.
