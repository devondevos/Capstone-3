# Capstone-3
My Todo List website.

Created using html, css, js (node.js, express, ajax, jquery) and bootstrap (the &copy; is not legit, I just added it there to look nice).

The 'Contact' and 'About' pages are empty because I intend to reuse it later.

To Start:
- npm install
- node index.js (if you have nodemon installed globally, use: nodemon index.js, nodemon auto restarts the server if you make changes to the files and save them.)

Where the user can submit data, edit data and delete data and is responsive to screen sizes.
